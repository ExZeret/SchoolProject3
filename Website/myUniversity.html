                <h3>About me</h3>
                <p>
                    I am currently a senior trying to branch out in learning more about computer science ranging from Web development to Data analysis, to even CyberSecurity.
                    I am originally from Cameroon, Africa but I have been living in the U.S. for over 10 Years.
                    I like playing video games and 3D Modeling on my spare time. I also enjoy visiting new places with my friends.
